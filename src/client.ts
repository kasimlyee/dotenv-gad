/**
 * dotenv-gad/client — browser-side entry point
 *
 
 * THIS FILE IS A STUB.                                       
 *                                                               
 *  When you use dotenv-gad inside a Vite project the plugin's  
 *  resolveId hook intercepts `import … from "dotenv-gad/client"
 *  BEFORE this file is ever touched, and rewires it to the     
 *  virtual:dotenv-gad module that contains your validated,     
 *  security-filtered env at build time.                        
 *                                                               
 *  If you reach this code at runtime it means the Vite plugin  
 *  is not installed — see the README for setup instructions.
